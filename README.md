The Riak Community
==================

There are many components to a successful open source software project. Code (and code quality) is only the first of many, and lot of times it's not the most important (for better or for worse). A Community is built around the code to help foster its growth, maturity, and adoption. Like the code, it needs to evolve, and unless it's moving forward and being refined continuously, it ceases to be valuable. 

I want to introduce the idea of "The Riak Community" as a releasable product. 

Each new release will signify the evolution of the Community: new docs will have been written; new talks will have been given;new slide decks will have been created; process flaws will have been unearthed and rectified. 

So why not approach community development like you would code? What if there were "release cycles", "bugs", and issues

This will be a way for us to track the progression of the community over time and build the community in a more collaborative, transparent way. There are people all over the world contributing to the growth of Riak in endless ways. This is an attempt at capturing and showcasing that growth.

### What Should Be Part Of A Community Release?

For the purposes of this project, a community release can include anything that's not code and that contributes to the advancement of the community as a whole. Some examples:

* A blog post about your team's Riak usage
* A slide deck you used at a local meetup
* Documentation you contributed for the Python client 
* A screencast we made to show new Riak Search features
* The 30 minutes you spent in the Mailing List to help a newcomer
* Adding the [Powered By Riak badge](http://wiki.basho.com/We-Run-Riak-Badges.html) to your site 

### How To Contribute And Use This Repo

1. Open an issue or a pull request with what you have contribute (applying tags as appropriate)

### Release Cycles and Versioning 

We probably won't get too in-depth with the versioning and release cycles. For now:

* A new release of the Riak Community will happen on the first work day of each month (time and resource-permitting)
* Each new version will be a minor version increase (i.e. "v.0.2" will follow "v.0.1")
