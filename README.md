The Riak Community
==================

There are many components to a successful open source software project. Code (and code quality) is only the first of many, and lot of times it's not the most important. The Community is built around the code to help foster its growth, maturity, and adoption. Like the code, it's evolving, and unless it's moving forward and being refined continuously, it ceases to be valuable.
