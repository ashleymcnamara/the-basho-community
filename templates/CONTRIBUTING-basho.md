#Notes
Below is a default CONTRIBUTING.md file for all repositories under the [Basho](https://github.com/basho/) organization. It's best to keep the Contributing header identical - please open a PR if you think it should change! 

All How-to contribute sections are recommended to be updated with the maintainer's preferred text. 

##Contributing

This repo's maintainers are engineers at Basho and we welcome your contribution to the project!

### An honest disclaimer

Due to our obsession with stability and our rich ecosystem of users, community updates on this repo take longer to review. 

The most helpful way to contribute is by reporting your experience through issues. Issues may not be updated while we review internally, but they're still incredibly appreciated.

Pull requests take multiple engineers for verification and testing. If you're passionate enough to want to learn more on how you can get hands on in this process, reach out to [Matt](mailto:mbrender@basho.com), your developer advocate. 

Thank you for being part of the community! We love you for it.
