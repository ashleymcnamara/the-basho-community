        - [ ] Manages features through Issues 

        - [ ] The work was completed with empathy for new users

        - [ ] The work was completed with empathy for future maintainers 

* **Creativity** - Does it make us smile? That x-factor that you canâ€™t put a number on

## About the Event

We want to have a friendly, uplifting competition headed into RICON 2015 that improves our community. Whether you can [attend RICON](http://bit.ly/ricon15e) or will **participate remotely**, jump in and share with your community!

The complete event is outlined at: http://bit.ly/ricon15comp

This file covers specific questions judges will ask themselves as they compare entries for the Best Demo RICON 2015 award. **This is not a complete list**, but rather a guide to think through some of the important details.
