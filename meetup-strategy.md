## Meetup Strategy

The goal of this document is to provide repeatable insight into how we execute on Meetups, both Basho as lead and Basho as a guest. You'll notice a distinct focus on **beginners** & **developers**. 

 Let's go over our terms before mapping out the timeline.

#### Types of Events

|Meetup Owned by Basho|Visiting local Meetup|at Tier 1 event [in beta]|
|--------|--------|----------|
Lecture|Lecture|Annual Bashochat
Hack Night|Hack Night|More formal private briefing

A **Lecture** is an event when we line up a speaker to talk for a majority of the event [45 min - 60 min] and focuses on sharing an expertise or an experience [Introduction to X or How We do Y].

A **Hack Night** is a format with a shorter speaking slot [10-20 minutes] and focuses on people coding together.

A **Show and Tell** is where the host gives a brief introduction [5 minutes] and then passes the stage to 2 or more speakers who go into how they're building their application. 

A **Tier 1** event is somewhere we have a booth and want to get a little something extra in our community efforts. These can be causal get-togethers or more formal briefings on product. We can also make an effort to attend or start a Meetup to overlap with events if we feel confident we can capture part of the audience's attention. This works well when done annually around a given event.

#### Timelines
To host one of these events smoothly, you should schedule a Meetup **3 weeks ahead of time**. 

#### Meetup Kits

We want to standardize on a Meetup kit so events become easy to run through. Standard: 
* 2 table top signs
* A pop up sign 
* Stickers 

#### Budget

We have between $200-$1,000 a month to support Meetup activities. Depending on the month, these funds could be allocated to between 3 to 5 events. We're looking for lightly budgeted lift here. 

**Options**:  
If you have a compelling, measurably-audience-grabbing idea for our Meetups, definitely share it. There are times that will be worth the extra effort and we're glad to get the idea. Open an Issue [here](https://github.com/basho-labs/the-riak-community/issues) or shoot me an [email](mailto:mbrender@basho.com).

If you feel your local Meetup could benefit from more funds, you're welcome ot work on local sponsorships that Meetup.com allows.
