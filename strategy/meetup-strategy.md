## Meetup Strategy

The goal of this document is to provide repeatable insight into how we execute on Meetups, both Basho as lead and Basho as a guest. You'll notice a distinct focus on **beginners** & **developers**. 

 Let's go over our terms before mapping out the timeline.

#### Types of Events

|Meetups run by Basho|Visiting local Meetup|at Tier 1 event [in beta]|
|--------|--------|----------|
Lecture|Lecture|Annual Bashochat
Hack Night|Hack Night|Private Briefing

A **Lecture** is an event when we line up a speaker to talk for a majority of the event [45 min - 60 min] and focuses on sharing an expertise or an experience [Introduction to X or How We do Y].

A **Hack Night** is a format with a shorter speaking slot [10-20 minutes] and focuses on people coding together.

A **Show and Tell** is where the host gives a brief introduction [5 minutes] and then passes the stage to 2 or more speakers who go into how they're building their application [15-20 minutes each]. Speakers are recommended to make the topic conversational in the sense that it has natural breaks in the talk track and "this is what we're doing, does this apply to you?" type of calls to action. The topic can dig into solving a particular distributed systems use case and a little about the how. Target a developer audience with appreciation for the beginner and advanced audience member (it's a tough balance, feel free to give a little to both). 

A **Tier 1** event is somewhere we have a booth and want to get a little something extra in our community efforts. These can be causal get-togethers or more formal briefings on product. We can also make an effort to attend or start a Meetup to overlap with events if we feel confident we can capture part of the audience's attention. This works well when done annually around a given event.

#### Timelines
To host one of these events smoothly, you should schedule a Meetup **3 weeks ahead of time**. 

#### Meetup Kits

We want to standardize on a Meetup kit so events become easy to run through. These include: 

* Signage (usually a pop-up stand)
* More than enough stickers
* A unique giveaway (i.e. Basho pint glass, stress ball, bobbleheads)

#### Budget

We have between $200-$1,000 a month to support Meetup activities. Depending on the month, these funds could be allocated to between 3 to 5 events. We're looking for lightly budgeted lift here. 

**Options**:  
If you have a compelling, measurably-audience-grabbing idea for our Meetups, definitely share it. There are times that will be worth the extra effort and we're glad to get the idea. Open an Issue [here](https://github.com/basho-labs/the-riak-community/issues) or shoot me an [email](mailto:mbrender@basho.com).

If you feel your local Meetup could benefit from more funds, you're welcome to work on local sponsorships that Meetup.com allows.
